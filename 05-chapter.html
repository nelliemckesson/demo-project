<p>Start <strong>writing</strong> here! <em>Replace</em> any of this <strong>placeholder</strong> <em>text</em> with your opus. We've included a few examples of <a contenteditable="false" data-original-title="" data-primary="math" data-secondary="equations" data-type="indexterm" title="">&nbsp;</a>commonly used book elements, but you can delete them. You can add any of these elements using the buttons in the toolbar, as well.</p>

<p>Here's an example of formatting a page with CSS:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\)</span></p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
@page { /* 7x9 Animal */
  size: 7in 9.1875in;
  margin: 0.75in 1in;
  border-bottom: 0.25pt solid cmyk(0%,0%,0%,100%);
  padding-bottom: 0.2in;
}</pre>

<blockquote data-type="epigraph">
<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>

<p>The above is a blockquote, and specifically it's an epigraph, with an attribution to the author. (Epigraphs are a subset of blockquotes.)</p>
